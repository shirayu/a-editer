# A-Editor

- An editor which works on web-browsers
- You can edit files in the designated folder
    - If you run the web server in your local machine, you can edit local files throw your web browsers
    - (This means you can run bookmarlets for your local files)
    - I recommend [tinytinyhttpd](https://github.com/mattn/tinytinyhttpd) for a web server because we can start up it very easier than other web servers
